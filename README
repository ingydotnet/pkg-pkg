Introduction
============

The `pkg` command line utility is an [Acmeist](http://acmeism.org) effort to
help create and maintain programming language modules in a simple and
consistent way. It makes no assumptions for you. You can configure it any way
you wish.

Installation
============

You will need to install the `pkg` command line tool. You can get it from CPAN
with this command:

    cpanm --sudo Package

Then you should fork this git repository on GitHub and configure it using your
own personal information and code styles.

Usage
=====

To create a new programming language module package, use a command like this:

    pkg new --from=pkg/perl/dzil --module=Foo::Bar

That will create a new directory called (by default) `./Foo-Bar/`, with all
your new module bits in it.
